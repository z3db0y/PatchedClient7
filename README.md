Un-fedding PC7 client

I have trusted BestBuy/AceSilentKill/Nova for way too long, and I even turned a blind eye on some questionable things:

-   PC7 is essentially a monetized fork of LaF, but where are the credits?
-   BestBuy is paranoid; as soon as I got locked, he PASTED [my library](https://npmjs.com/package/discord-rpc-revamp) by downloading it from NPM. This can be seen in the JSC bytecode as the symbols of his new-rpc.jsc file or whatever it's called; 1:1 with my file, and yet again I ask - where are the credits?
-   I have been lied to; while seeming like a good person, BestBuy [lied straight to my face](https://imgur.com/a/AVL9WYR) with a story that didn't make any sense ref: ["we don't log launches anymore"](https://imgur.com/a/LZ6ch9i). While I am a cheat developer, and he is essentially a fed, being honest was the least I could have expected of him.
-   Hmm, I wonder what else encodes packets like [this](https://imgur.com/a/diKB6E9)... I suppose software involving execution of commands from a command & control server AKA a Remote Access Tool? Coincidence? surely.
-   Last but not least, schizophrenia. More on that later as this involves someone I cannot mention.

## The purpose of this repo

Let's see how BestBuy likes is now that none of his trackers/analytics work... This will contain a patcher that makes PC7 unable to send requests to their APIs, so you no longer have to question the authenticity/trustworthiness of PC7 client.

## Epilogue

Oh yea, who would've known that their alt manager is [stored in config.json](https://imgur.com/a/X5PuwFI)...

BestBuy, you've had your chanceS - I'm pretty gullible,  
this means war.
